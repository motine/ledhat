# LED Hat

Some code to make Stefan's hat glow.

Please see the [video](https://youtu.be/ExxrtV-L5mQ).

The same requisites as in [four_point_o](https://github.com/motine/four_point_o) apply.

It's not well documented, because I made this in 3 hours, but may serve as a reference.
Also, one is not supposed to put implementations into header files and the modes should be more generic (e.g. pass the arrays to the constructor)...
